# Describing JSON Data

JSON stands for **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation and is a data format whereby data can be efficiently transfered from server to client and vice versa. 

Communication between server and client can take place in many formats. Some like html provide design, which may already exist on client device and is data intensive. In some cases, however, you may only want to send data. For simple data, information could be sent as plain text. However, for more complex objects, plain text would be limiting in the sense that parsing the data would be difficult on the client device. **JSON** on the other hand is lightweight, [easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). 

For the purposes of R, JSON data can be accessed from APIs [(**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface)](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api), which is itself a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to eachother. Once JSON data has been accessed however, it must be converted into an object format that is recognizeable by R.   

There are three primary packages available in R to perform this conversion, `jsonlite()`, `rjsonio()` and `rjson()`. While all three can convert JSON data to/from R objects they differ in terms of 1) ease of use, 2) availability of funcitons to stream, validate and prettifu JSON data and 3) their performance. [A biased comparison of JSON packages in R](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/31702_9c22e3d1a0c44968a4a1f9656f1800ab.html) runs a series of excercises comparising behavior and performance of JSON packages in R. The takeaway from this comparison seems to be that `jsonlite()` offers the best balance of functionality and performance. For this reason and based on the fact that `jsonlite()` is the sole package we have been exposed to in prior assignments, I have opted to use it for this vignette.  

# Reading in Data

In this section we are reading in data from the NHL API. This corresponds to the first five stars on the Project PDF. For franchise specific queries, I have elected to look into statistics for the Pittsburgh Penguins.

```{r pens_logo, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\ocwag\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Stat-for-Data-Science\\Project_1\\pens_logo.png")
```

## Reading in Franchise data

A base nhl url was created to facilitate queries on the NHL API.

```{r reading in franchise data}

base_nhl_url <- "https://records.nhl.com/site/api" 

franchise_url<-paste0(base_nhl_url,"/franchise")

franchise_GET<-GET(franchise_url)%>%
  content(as="text")%>%
  fromJSON(flatten = TRUE)
```

## Reading in total stats for every franchise

```{r reading in total stats data}
team_total_url<-paste0(base_nhl_url,"/franchise-team-totals")

team_total_GET<-GET(team_total_url)%>%
  content(as="text")%>%
  fromJSON(flatten = TRUE)
```

## Reading in Penguins Franchise Record Data

```{r reading in pens franchise record data}

PIT_records_url<-paste0(base_nhl_url,"/franchise-season-records?cayenneExp=franchiseId=","17")

PIT_records_GET<-GET(PIT_records_url)%>%
  content(as="text")%>%
  fromJSON(flatten = TRUE)
```

## Reading in Penguins Goalie Records

```{r reading in pens goalie records}

PIT_goalie_url<-paste0(base_nhl_url,"/franchise-goalie-records?cayenneExp=franchiseId=","17")

PIT_goalie_GET<-GET(PIT_goalie_url)%>%
  content(as="text")%>%
  fromJSON(flatten = TRUE)
```

## Reading in Penguins Skater Records

```{r reading in pens skater records}

PIT_skater_url<-paste0(base_nhl_url,"/franchise-skater-records?cayenneExp=franchiseId=","17")

PIT_skater_GET<-GET(PIT_skater_url)%>%
  content(as="text")%>%
  fromJSON(flatten = TRUE)
```

# Building summary tables and diagrams

Below we take the necessary steps to make data tables more visually appealing. At least one summary table, statistical table and/or diagram has been generated for each of the five data queries above. 

## Timeline graphic for NHL franchises

There have been 38 franchises in the history of the NHL not counting teams that moved and were then returned (Winnipeg Jets, for example). Of the 38, 7 have been permanently disbanded. While some teams have been around since the early 1900s, most active teams, including the Penguins, came into existance in the late 60s/ early 70s.

```{r timeline graphic, fig.width=9, fig.height=9}

names(franchise_GET)<-substring(names(franchise_GET),6)

franchise_table<-franchise_GET[[1]]  
  
franchise_years<-franchise_table%>%
  mutate("first_year"=as.numeric(substring(firstSeasonId,1,4)),
         "last_year"=as.numeric(ifelse(is.na(lastSeasonId),2020,substring(lastSeasonId,5,))),
         "full_name"=paste(teamPlaceName,teamCommonName))

franchise_years%>%
ggplot(aes(x=first_year, xend=last_year, y=reorder(full_name,desc(full_name)), yend=full_name))+
  geom_segment(size=6, color="blue")+
  xlab("Years Active")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1915, 2020, 5))+
  ylab("Franchise Name")+
  labs(title="NHL Franchises: Years Active")
```

## Which conferences are the least law abiding?
A new column has been created to show penalty minues per game to provide a basis of comparison for older and newer teams. All teams have been joined with their appropriate conferences to see which conference have been most abiding of the rules over time. 

The Answer? Atlantic conference teams rack up the fewest penalty minutes per game, on average, and also show the tightest distribution around the mean. Teams in the Metropolitan conference, by contrast rack up, on average, an additional 1.6 minutes of penalty time per game. 

```{r penalty mins graphic}
team_total_table<-team_total_GET[[1]]
  
summed_games_penalties<-team_total_table%>%
  select(franchiseId,teamName,gamesPlayed,wins,losses,ties,penaltyMinutes)%>%
  group_by(franchiseId,teamName)%>%
  summarize_all(funs(sum))%>%
  mutate("win_percent"=wins/gamesPlayed,"pen_mins_game"=penaltyMinutes/gamesPlayed)

nhl_conferences<-read_csv("C:\\Users\\ocwag\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Stat-for-Data-Science\\Project_1\\Project_1\\nhl_conferences.csv")

games_penalties_conferences<-nhl_conferences%>%
  select(-teamName)%>%
  full_join(summed_games_penalties,nhl_conferences,by="franchiseId")%>%
  filter(conference !="Defunct")

games_penalties_conferences%>%
ggplot(aes(x=conference,y=pen_mins_game,color=conference))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_jitter()+
  ylab("Penalty Minutes Per Game")
```

```{r penalty mins table}
kable(games_penalties_conferences%>%
  group_by(conference)%>%
  summarize("Average Penalty Minutes Per Game"=round(mean(pen_mins_game),1)))
```

## A look at the Penguins best years

### Timeline table

PIT_records_GET_df<-as.data.frame(PIT_records_GET)
names(PIT_records_GET_df)<-substring(names(PIT_records_GET_df),6)
```

### build accolades table

```{r build accolade table}
PIT_records_accolade<-PIT_records_GET_df%>%select(-ends_with("Seasons"), -ends_with("Streak"), -ends_with("Dates"),-"id")

accolades_table<-as.data.frame(t(PIT_records_accolade))%>%
  rownames_to_column("Accolade")%>%
  .[-18,]%>%
  rename("Metric"="1")
```

  rownames_to_column("Accolade")%>%
  rename("Streak"="1")
```

### build dates table

```{r build dates table}
PIT_records_dates<-PIT_records_GET_df%>%select(ends_with("StreakDates"))

names(PIT_records_dates)=str_remove(names(PIT_records_dates),"StreakDates")

dates_table<-as.data.frame(t(PIT_records_dates))%>%
  rownames_to_column("Accolade")%>%
  rename("Dates"="1")
```

### Interactive Accolades Kable

```{r build accolades kable}
accolade_names<-c(accolades_table$Accolade)

first_nice_names<-toupper(gsub("([[:lower:]])([[:upper:]])", "\\1 \\2", accolade_names))

best_years<-full_join(accolades_table,seasons_table)%>%
  mutate("Accolade"=first_nice_names)%>%
  filter(Accolade != "FRANCHISE ID" & Accolade !="FRANCHISE NAME")

kable(best_years)
```

### Interactive Streak Kable

```{r build streak kable}
streak_names<-c(streak_table$Accolade)

second_nice_names<-toupper(gsub("([[:lower:]])([[:upper:]])", "\\1 \\2", streak_names))

best_streaks<-full_join(streak_table,dates_table)%>%
  mutate("Accolade"=second_nice_names)

kable(best_streaks)
```

## Some Pittsburgh Goalie Stats

Below we present two code chunks. The first produces a statistical summary of the "Mosts per Game" and "Mosts per Season" for Pittsburgh's goalies. The Second illustrates games played and game outcomes for Pittsburgh's goalies over the years. 

### Goalie statistics summary

Distribution of most shutouts and most wins per seasons are skewed heavily to the right.

```{r goalie table}
PIT_goalie_table<-PIT_goalie_GET[[1]]

pit_goalie_game_season<-PIT_goalie_table%>%
  select(mostGoalsAgainstOneGame, mostSavesOneGame, mostShotsAgainstOneGame, 
         mostShutoutsOneSeason, mostWinsOneSeason)

goalie_tab_colnames<-c(colnames(pit_goalie_game_season))

goalie_nice_names<-toupper(gsub("([[:lower:]])([[:upper:]])", "\\1 \\2", goalie_tab_colnames))

colnames(pit_goalie_game_season)<-goalie_nice_names

pit_goalie_game_season%>%
  sapply(summary,digits=2)%>%
  kable()
```

### Goalie game outcome diagram

Keith Fleury has logged more games at goalie than any other person in history of the franchise and roughly 2/3rds of the games he played in ended in a win. 

```{r goalie game outcome}
tidy_goalie_table<-PIT_goalie_table%>%
  select(lastName,wins,losses,ties)%>%
  mutate("total_games"=rowSums(.[,c("wins","ties","losses")],na.rm =TRUE))%>%
  gather(key="game_outcome",value="games",wins,losses,ties)
  

tidy_goalie_table%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(lastName,desc(total_games)),y=games))+
  geom_col(aes(fill=game_outcome))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+
  xlab("Goalie")+
  ylab("Total Games")+
  labs(fill="Game Outcome")
```

## Skater Records - which positions rack up the penalty minutes fastest?

Pittsburgh's Defenders and Left Wingers rack up penalty minutes at the fastest clip while right wingers accumulate them more slowly. 

```{r skater penalty minutes}
PIT_skater_table<-PIT_skater_GET[[1]]

pos_labels<-(c(C="Center",D ="Defense",L="Left Wing",R="Right Wing"))

PIT_skater_table%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=seasons, y=penaltyMinutes))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm,se=F)+
  ylab("Penalty Minutes")+
  facet_grid(~positionCode,labeller = labeller(positionCode=pos_labels))
```
